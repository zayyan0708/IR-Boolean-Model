# IR-Boolean-Model
Information Retrieval project which aims to retrieve relevant documents against a Boolean query. 
This program, created using Python and featuring a responsive graphical user interface, aims to demonstrate the functionality of various indexes in retrieving queries from a collection. To facilitate this, two types of indexes have been implemented: an Inverted index and a Positional index. The Stopword_list.txt contains a list of all stopwords that will be removed from the collection of documents prior to retrieval.
